# Cat Counter: A Code Exercise

This application counts the number of occurrences of an arbitrary word (in this case 'cat') in an arbitrary text file or raw string input.

## Description
This application was created for a take-home exercise and serves to locate occurrences of a User-selected word in a User-selected text. The text may be either a text file (*.txt) or raw string input.
Searching occurs in one of two modes:

* Lax - Finds the character sequence provided (i.e. 'caterpillar' and 'cat' both match 'cat')
* Strict - Finds the exact word provided (i.e. 'the cat' matches 'cat' but 'caterpillar' does not)

The results of the operation are reported via Console stdout to the screen and are not persisted. The application is invoked via command line with arguments, see "Running the Application" for more details.
